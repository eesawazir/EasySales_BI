# EasySales BI

This is a business intelligence internal tool I developed at EasyTech International Sdn Bhd.
The tool activates or deactivate users making using of the EasySales Ecosystem.
Additionally, it allows the update of user details stored in the company database.

The tool was made using React, TypeScript and Material UI. In addition to the tool itself, I also implemented API endpoints in the companies centralized API to perform database updates 

The code for the project is company property so I can not put it here. Here is an image of the tool:<br> <br>
